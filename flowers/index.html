        <h2>What is a flower?</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        The flower is the reproductive part of a flowering plant [3].
      </p>
      <p>
        A flowering plant, like a fern, is also a vascular plant. However, it is more complicated. Not only does it have the xylum, but also a <strong>phloem</strong>. The phloem is made up of living tissue. It works by using cell walls to pump nutrients throughout the plant [2]. Also unlike the fern, flowering plants reproduce through seeds produced by the flower.
      </p>
      <p>
        Flowers are very beautiful, but they play an important role. They are very attractive to pollinators who can carry pollen from the stamen of a male plant to the stigma of a female plant, giving us new seeds and more plants [3].
